I'm a software engineer and a boxing gym owner who is passionate about creating technology to elevate small-businesses and driven to help people live up to their potential.  On my down time, I submit to a hellacious amount of Burpees.  100, 300, 500 Reps per workout session.  

On December 31, 2020 I completed 1,000 straight 1-pump Burpees in 1hr:47min.  Why?  Because it trains my mind to overcome self-imposed adversity.  

The benefits of this mental and physical hardening flows over into my other professional endeavors.  It helps me to take a step back from, say, a persistent coding challenge and walk my way through to a successful conclusion - one rep, one bug at a time.   

Some technologies I enjoy working with include ReactJS, GraphQL, and the Firebase Suite.
