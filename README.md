I'm a software engineer and a boxing gym owner who is obsessed with marrying my passions for technology and fitness.  My journey thus far has blessed me with enriching opportunities in both worlds.  On the technology front, I've built solutions that have helped local businesses improve customer engagement and boost revenue.  On the fitness side, I've helped clients find a deeper level of personal power and positive mental health by way of my fitness coaching.  

On my down time, I submit myself to a hellacious amount of Burpees, of all types: 6 count, 8 count, Navy Seals, Body Builders, Commandos... the list goes on and on for 100, 300, 500 Reps per workout.  

On December 31, 2020 I completed 1,000 straight 1-pump Burpees in 1hr:47min.  Why?  Because high-rep workouts train my mind to overcome self-imposed adversity.  

This level of physical and mental rigor benefits my developer mindset.  During a persistent coding quagmire, the mental toughness I've forged during these transcendent workouts help me remain steadfast and press forward through the problem - one rep at a time, one bug at a time.   

The technologies I enjoy working with include NextJS, Tailwind, and the Firebase Suite.
