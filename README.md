I'm a cybersecurity professional in the making, blending a background in fitness coaching, web development, and IT with a strategic career transition into cybersecurity. I hold certifications including A+, Network+, Security+, and AZ-900, with BTL1 - SOC Analyst and CCNA in progress, alongside a B.S. in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance.

My journey thus far has blessed me with enriching opportunities in many worlds.  On the technology front, I've built solutions that have helped local businesses improve customer engagement and boost revenue.  On the fitness side, I've helped clients find a deeper level of personal power and positive mental health.  

Through my Renaissance Technologist YouTube channel, I document my journey, sharing practical insights and strategies to inspire career changers and tech enthusiasts.
