I'm a software engineer and a boxing gym owner who is passionate about creating technology that elevate small-businesses and driven to help people live up to their potential.  

On my down time, I submit myself to a hellacious amount of Burpees, of all types: 6 count, 8 count, Navy Seals, Body Builders, Commandos... the list goes on and on for 100, 300, 500 Reps per workout.  

On December 31, 2020 I completed 1,000 straight 1-pump Burpees in 1hr:47min.  Why?  Because high-rep workouts train my mind to overcome self-imposed adversity.  

This level of physical and mental rigor benefits my developer mindset.  During a persistent coding quandary, the fortitude and mindfulness forged during my workouts help me remain steadfast and inches me through the predicament - one rep at a time, one bug at a time.   

Some technologies I enjoy working with include ReactJS, GraphQL, and the Firebase Suite.
