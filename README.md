I'm a software engineer who is passionate about creating technology to elevate small-businesses, inspiring people to uncover their fitness potential, and leading from the front in support of mentoring young people. Some technologies I enjoy working with include ReactJS, GraphQL, and the Firebase Suite. 

I have held a diverse collection of positions in various industries. From Wall Street to the Boxing Gym, I have collaborated, negotiated, and lead people from different walks-of-life. This wonderful web of experiences has helped me realize how much I enjoy emotionally investing in people's growth and road to success. 

Strong communication skills is a transformative trait that I have developed as a result.
